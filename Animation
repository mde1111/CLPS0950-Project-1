%Katie Yetter  3/3/21
%Currently I have  two images: Both are 3 month male sternomastoid images: animal524_40x_03 from a HOM and animal551_40x_02 from a WT animal.
%Channel 1 - postsynaptic (muscle endplate) & channel 2 - presynaptic (nerve terminal).
  %Maybe just compare these two? Is that enough? Maybe include  an animated picture of what it looks like all together, then provide these 2?

%Creating animation: Display picture of neuromuscular junction image, provide a key (legend) so users can select different parts of the neuromuscular junction to explore

imread = ('file:///Users/katieyetter/Pictures/Experimental%20Design%20main%20image.jpg'); %Photo of the initial experimental design
c(img)
Axis image;
Axis off;

%Legend for key press: ADD KEYS
title(‘Key’, ‘Interpreter’, ‘None’, ‘Fontsize’, 20, ‘Fontweight’, ‘bold’);
Str = sprintf

%Display instructions
Screen('TextSize', window, 18);
Screen('TextFont', window, 'Courier');
DrawFormattedText(window, 'Instructions:', 18, 50, [0 0 0]);
DrawFormattedText(window, 'Refer to the legend to choose which image you want to see!', 20, 50, [0 1 0]);
Screen('Flip', window);


% These next pieces of code  are to call the images up: still have to figure out which one to use

%Press a Key based on the legend to see a specific part of the neuromuscular junction: ADD IMAGE NAMES/ALL AVAILABLE IMAGES
[keyIsDown, secs, keyCode] = KbCheck;
if (key=='q')
  % image = loadimage('110819_animal551_40x_02.tif') 
if (key=='w')
  % image = loadimage('111019_animal524_40x_03.tif')

%This code will allow two images to be brought onto the same window side-by-side
%I will want to do this multiple times based on key input
