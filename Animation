%Currently I have  two images: Channel 1 - postsynaptic (muscle endplate) & channel 2 - presynaptic (nerve terminal).
  %Maybe just compare these two? Is that enough? Maybe include  an animated picture of what it looks like all together, then provide these 2?

%Creating animation: Display picture of neuromuscular junction image, provide a key (legend) so users can select different parts of the neuromuscular junction to explore

Image = imread('110819_animal551_40x_02.tif'); %Directly import main neuromuscular junction image to be the main screen - HOM mouse
imagesc(Image)
Axis image;
Axis off;

%Legend for key press: ADD KEYS
title(‘Key’, ‘Interpreter’, ‘None’, ‘Fontsize’, 20, ‘Fontweight’, ‘bold’);
Str = sprintf

%Display instructions
Screen('TextSize', window, 18);
Screen('TextFont', window, 'Courier');
DrawFormattedText(window, 'Instructions:', 18, 50, [0 0 0]);
DrawFormattedText(window, 'Refer to the legend to choose which image you want to see!', 20, 50, [0 1 0]);
Screen('Flip', window);

%Press a Key based on the legend to see a specific part of the neuromuscular junction: ADD IMAGE NAMES/ALL AVAILABLE IMAGES
[keyIsDown, secs, keyCode] = KbCheck;
if (key=='q')
  % image = loadimage(IMAGENAME)
if (key=='w')
  % image = loadimage(IMAGENAME)

%This code will allow two images to be brought onto the same window side-by-side
%I will want to do this multiple times based on key input
[X1,map1]=imread('110819_animal551_40x_02.tif'); %This is the main image
[X2,map2]=imread('add image name here'); %This is the image I am comparing to the main image, based on the key press
subplot(1,2,1), imshow(X1,map1)
subplot(1,2,2), imshow(X2,map2)
